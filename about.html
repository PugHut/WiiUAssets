            <p>Hi! I'm Pughut, I do stupid tech stuff and music. I'm in a band called TBD and we are working on our first album.</p>

            <h1>(Now about the site...)</h1>
            <p>I made this site to make sure people don't have to deal with the pain I had to go through to rip the Wii U Home menu assets.</p>
            <p>So far, I've only ripped Wara Wara Plaza and the Gamepad screen. Eventually, this site might become an all around model source (Kinda like the models resource!)</p>
            <p>If you wish for an asset to be ripped you can email me here:</p>
            <a href="mailto:mrpug@pughutstudios.com">mrpug@pughutstudios.com</a>
            <p>(Or if you are Nintento and you want me to kill myself for ripping ten year old assets easilly availible for access...)</p>
